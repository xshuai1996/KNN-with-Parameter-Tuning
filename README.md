# KNN with Parameter Tuning

This project includes an implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN), and parameter tuning parts with / without scaling to find the best K, best distance function, and best scaler method.

Distance functions include:
 - Canberra Distance
 - Minkowski Distance
 - Euclidean distance
 - Inner product distance
 - Gaussian kernel distance
 - Cosine Similarity
 
Scaling functions include:
 - Min-Max Scaler
 - Normalization (i.e. to unit vectors)
 
Evaluation function:
 - F1 Score
